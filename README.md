- 👋 Hi, I’m @JackGrz
- 👀 I’m interested in politics as well as video games, but not video games with political messages (unless it is Metal Gear Solid). I am also greatly interested in culinary arts and the wine world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & Javascript programming languages for my "Programming for the arts" course at UCSC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything as anything is a learning experience since I'm a novice.
- 📫 How to reach me... idk if I should put my email here.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fluent in English & Brazilian Portuguese. Looking to be fluent in a programming language in the future (for personal projects).
